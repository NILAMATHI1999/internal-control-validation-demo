This prototype simulates how an Internal Control team can automate validation of control data received from multiple countries. Instead of manually checking Excel files, Python-based validation rules detect missing submissions, out-of-range values, and data inconsistencies. KPIs such as submission rate and error rate help management quickly understand control health across regions. The exception report can be shared back with countries for correction, and the validated data can be visualized in Power BI for global reporting.
